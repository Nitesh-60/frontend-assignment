# FRONTEND PROBLEM STATEMENT

Write code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a simple timer web app. Users can input minutes and/or seconds, and after clicking on the START button, a timer will start from the input time to 00:00.

## Points to remember:

1. Add basic validations in input (Ex: Seconds cannot be more than 59, etc)
2. The UI can be of your choice, and should be mobile-friendly.
3. Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
4. Do not use any CSS libraries like Bootstrap, Material, Tailwind, etc.
5. Do not use any external JavaScript libraries or packages.

## Please push your code to a public GitHub repository and share the link.
